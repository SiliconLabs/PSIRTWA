This is the main branch of Silicon Labs security advisory repository. Workarounds are organized into where the name of the folder matches the advisory that the workaround applies to. 
Note: This repo is being archived since official fixes have been published and the workarounds here are deemed to be of limited benefit. Links will remain active but no further changes are planned for this repo nor any of it's contents.
